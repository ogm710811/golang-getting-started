# Golang Getting Started

Go is a fully compiled language from Google. Designed from the ground up to be simple and powerful, many developers find it to be a joy to program in and are impressed by how easy it is to solve many difficult programming tasks.

In this project, I will show Go language itself. Ypu are going to find branches and loops, arithmetic operators, functions, structs and fields, data types, goroutines and channels. All of them in small examples that show how they work. I built a real-world application using all the concepts of the language.
